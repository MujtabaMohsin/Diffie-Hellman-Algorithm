# Diffie Hellman Algorithm
This project implements the Diffie Hellman algorithm using Java. It was programmed by me and Mr.Faisal Sattar as a project for the Discrete Structures II course in April 2018.

The program will take two numbers from the user:
- Prime modulo P
- base B

Then two cryptographic keys will be generated.
